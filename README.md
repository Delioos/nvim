# my conf 
not using kickstart anymore, built my personal conf from the base of @theprimeagen ytb vids. It's in the roule folder, and use the script storred in after/plugin. If you want to  keep my config and the default one wanna create a custom for yourself, just create a new dir at the same level of roule and kickstart, and change the line in init.lua (kind of main) 


## install dependencies

### packer
go to packer file run ```:so``` then run ```:PackerSync``` then 

### mason
```:Mason ``` and use U to Update all mason plugins
